Some Story Edition stuff (excluding most of the SE-only charts) are leftover by the way, including the old ones, maybe for the old songs, just maybe, if FoxaTheArtist ever plans to keep the old songs seperately (I doubt. :D).

Anyways, enjoy!!!!

ABOUT EDITING:
It doesn't matter if you want to edit something in assets/shared/images/, you will have to put the editted files in either mods/[Your Mod Here]/images/. it will be handled automatically by the engine.
